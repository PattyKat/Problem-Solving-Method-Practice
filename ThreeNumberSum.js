//write a function that takes in a non-empty array of disctinct integers and an integer representing the target sum.  The function should find all triplets in the array that sum up to the target and return a two-dimensional array of all these triplets.

//the numbers in each triplet should be in acsending order and the triplets themselves should be ordered in ascending order w/ respect to the numbers they hold.

//sample Input
  //array = [12, 3, 1, 2, -6, 5, -8, 6]
  //targetSum = 0
//sample output
  //[[-8, 2, 6], [-8, 3, 5], [-6, 1, 5]]


function threeNumberSum(array, targetSum){

}

//I: array of intgerts and target integer
//O: array of arrays w/ 3 integers
//C: n/a
//E:  if empty input or no three numbers add to target, return empty array
