// Course Schedule
// There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.
// Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
// Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
// Example 1:
// Input: 3, [[1, 0], [2, 1]]

// Output: true

// Explanation: There are 3 courses to take. You must take course 0 to take course 1, and you must take course 1 to take course 2, so itâ€™s possible.

// Example 2:
// Input: 2, [[1, 0], [0, 1]]

// Output: false

// Explanation: There are 2 courses to take. You must take course 0 to take course 1, but you must take course 1 to take course 0. This is not possible

// Notes:
// The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices.
// You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
